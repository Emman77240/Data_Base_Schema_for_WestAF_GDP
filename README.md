## Data Base Schema for WestAF GDP

This is an implementation of the Data Definition and Data Manipulation Languages (DDLs &amp; DDMs) that I used in designing the database required for my app (WestAF GDP).  

## Description

I created a 'myGDPdata' database using the RDMS-MariaDB. 

-Using your favorite IDE, run the python script which creates the database 'myGDPdata'.

-Comment out the line of code that created the database, and run the script again in order to create the tables and also to insert values into the tables.

-View the table dump by opeining the 'myGDPdataCL.sql' file.

Congratulations!! You have now created a database with some sample data inserted in it
